NUMPY


The script allows acquisitions using FLIR machine vision cameras
There are three modes of acquisition

1) trigger - This mode senses when there is a higher than background signal and starts an acquisition. All frames are accumulated and stopped when background is restored
2) time - This mode acquires for a user-set time saving each frame individually
3) continuous - This mode acquires and saves each frame individually until interupted by the user
4) external - This mode uses an external trigger that interfaces with the I/O of the camera

with the exception of time mode, the programme will not stop running until a keyboard interupt (Ctrl+c) is triggered

For further description of the config parameters see the acompannying document 

RUN:

python3 Basic_acquisition.py ./PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE_1 ./PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE_2* ./PATH_TO_SAVE_OUTPUT

*Note - The software will only use this is a second camera is attached and the mode 'multi' is enabled. The cameras will simultaneously capture and will only work if the cameras are being operated in the same acquisition mode (as specifed above)
